/*Implement a Unique Sorted Union
Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should have a function named uniteUnique.
The uniteUnique function should accept two or more arrays as arguments.
The function should return a new array that contains unique values from the argument arrays, in the order they are first found in the arguments. For example, an input like [1, 2, 4], [2, 3, 5] would have an output of [1, 2, 4, 3, 5].*/


function uniteUnique(...arr) {
  let arrFinal = []

  for (const numb of arr) {
      for (const dig of numb) {
        if (!arrFinal.includes(dig)) {
          arrFinal.push(dig)
        }
      }
    }
    return arrFinal
}
