In this lab, you will create a function that takes an initial array as its first argument, followed by one or more additional arguments representing the values to remove.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

The destroyer function should return a new array excluding all elements from the first argument that match any of the subsequent arguments.
The function must accept an indeterminate number of arguments.

function destroyer (arr, ...arg) {
  const finalArr = arr.filter((num) => !arg.includes(num))
  return finalArr
