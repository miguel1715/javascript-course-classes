/*
Build a String Repeating Function
In this lab, you will create a function that repeats a given string a specific number of times. For the purpose of this lab, do not use the built-in .repeat() method.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should create a function named repeatStringNumTimes that takes two parameters: a string and a number.
The function should return the string repeated the specified number of times.
If the number is less than or equal to zero, the function should return an empty string.
*/


function repeatStringNumTimes(str, nmb) {
    let final = "";
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nmb; i++) {
      final = final.concat(str)
  }
      return final
}
