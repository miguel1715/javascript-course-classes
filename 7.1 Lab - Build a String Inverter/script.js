/*Build a String Inverter
In this lab, you will build a simple string inverter that reverses the characters of a given string.

For example, "hello" should become "olleh".

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should create a function named reverseString that takes a string as an argument.
The function should return the reversed string.*/


function reverseString(str) {
  let stage1 = str.split("");
  let stage2 = stage1.reverse();
  let stage3 = stage2.join("");

  return stage3
}


// I later found out it could be done this way: 


function reverseString2(str) {
    return str.split("").reverse().join("");
}
