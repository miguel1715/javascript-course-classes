/*Design a Sum All Numbers Algorithm
In this lab, you will need to design a sum all numbers algorithm.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should have a function named sumAll that accepts an array of two numbers.
sumAll([n, m]) should return the sum of n and m plus the sum of all the numbers between them. The lowest number will not always come first. For example, sumAll([4,1]) should return 10 because sum of all the numbers between 1 and 4 (both inclusive) is 10.*/

function sumAll([n, m]) {
  let result = 0;
  if (n > m) {
    for (let i = n; i >= m; i--) {
      result += i;
    }
  } else {
    for (let i = n; i <= m; i++){
      result += i;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
