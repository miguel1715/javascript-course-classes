/*
Build a Book Organizer
Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should have an array of objects named books where each object in the array should have a string title, another string authorName, and a number releaseYear.

Your books array should have a minimum of three objects.

You should have a callback function named sortByYear that accepts two books as parameter for sorting the array.

The sortByYear function should return -1 if the releaseYear of the first book is smaller than that of the second book.

The sortByYear function should return 1 if the releaseYear of the first book is bigger than that of the second book.

The sortByYear function should return 0 if both releaseYear values are equal.

You should filter out books written after a certain year such as 1950 from the books array and save the filtered array in a new array named filteredBooks.

You should sort the books in the filteredBooks array according to their releaseYear in ascending order. You learned in a prior lesson that the sort() method will sort the array in place. This means the filteredBooks array will be mutated.
